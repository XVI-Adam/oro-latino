# Oro Latino — La Ruta

Skeleton of a single-page, editorial walkthrough of a NYC Latino jewelry store,
structured as a numbered route index:

- **00 · La Vitrina** — the storefront
- **01 · Adentro** — the interior
- **02 · Cadenas** — the chain case

Everything is placeholder gray boxes for now — no assets yet.

## Run

ES modules need HTTP (not `file://`). From this directory:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8777
```

Then open http://localhost:8777/index.html

## Architecture

Fixed **1848×1080 design coordinate system**. All layout math — canvas *and*
DOM — is in design pixels; the whole `#stage` is scaled to the viewport with a
single CSS transform and letterboxed (`js/stage.js`).

- **`<canvas>`** (`js/render.js`) — all visual / physical content: backdrops
  and labeled placeholder boxes.
- **DOM overlay** (`js/overlay.js`) — crisp chrome: route-index numerals,
  bilingual (ES/EN) labels, action buttons, logo mark.
- **State machine** (`js/state.js`) —
  `GATE_CLOSED → GATE_OPENING → STOREFRONT → ENTERING → INTERIOR → CASE_FOCUS → PIECE_DETAIL`.
  `ENTERING` is transient and auto-advances.
- **The gate** (`js/gate.js`) — the signature opening interaction. A fully
  procedural roll-down security gate (corrugated slats, growing cylinder, brass
  handle rail, light bleed, side tracks). **Drag or scroll up** to roll it open.
  Physics: an inverted spring `S·(pos − 0.5)` makes it feel heavy below halfway
  and spring-assist above (0.5 is a tipping point). Release early and it rattles
  back down and bounces on the sill; cross the tip and it snaps home, latches,
  screen-shakes, and advances to `STOREFRONT`. No images. See the header comment
  in `gate.js` for the model.
- **The chains** (`js/chains.js`) — the `CASE_FOCUS` scene is a rail of 22
  draggable gold chains simulated with **Verlet integration**. Each chain is a
  16–22 particle rope draped over its disc holder (pinned at *both* top ends, so
  gravity settles it into a natural **catenary**), relaxed 6× per fixed step.
  Grab anywhere to drag; the tip pendant carries extra mass (inverse-mass
  constraint weighting) for swing inertia; an idle breeze sways them. Only the
  touched chain **+ its two neighbors** are simulated — every resting chain is
  blitted from a pre-composited offscreen layer, recomposited only when the
  active set changes; hovering wakes chains. A quick tap opens the piece detail.
  Press **`D`** to toggle the physics debug view (particles, constraints, active
  set, fps). Measured 60fps with a drag live.
- **Debug panel** (`js/debug.js`) — jump directly to any state.
- **`js/config.js`** — the single source of truth: palette, design constants,
  route index, and per-state scene data (the placeholder boxes).

Interactive boxes carry a `to:` state in `config.js`, get a vermilion dot +
gold hover border on the canvas, and are click/hover hit-tested in `js/main.js`.
